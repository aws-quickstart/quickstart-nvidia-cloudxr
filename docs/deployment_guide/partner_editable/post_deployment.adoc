== Postdeployment steps

=== Test the deployment

When the AWS CloudFormation template has successfully created the stack, all server nodes will be running with the Autodesk VRED application installed on your AWS account. To access the application, from your preferred browser, open the VRED URL listed in the *Outputs* tab.

The Partner Solution creates VRED instances and an associated security group to enable connection from the CloudXR client or from the NICE DCV web URL. The Partner Solution output displays the primary node URL. Collect the secondary server IP details from the Auto Scaling group instance details.
