image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/nvidia-cloudxr-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed Network Address Translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources.
** Windows EC2 instance manages the environment to ensure primary and collaborators see the same thing in real time:
*** The primary node acts as an orchestrator for the collaborator nodes for simultaneous work to be completed in a virtual reality environment.
** An Auto Scaling group of G4dn or G5 Windows EC2 instances running NVIDIA CloudXR (not shown), Steam VR (not shown), and NICE DCV (not shown) for remote access.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
