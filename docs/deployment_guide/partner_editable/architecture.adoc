As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the subnets.
** An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) Windows instance for the Autodesk VRED primary node that allows the primary user to share and view (in real time) with collaborators.
** NVIDIA CloudXR, https://store.steampowered.com/about/[Steam VR^], and https://download.nice-dcv.com/[NICE DCV^] installed to Autodesk VRED collaborator nodes in an Auto Scaling group. You can choose G4dn or G5 EC2 instance types for the collaborator nodes during deployment.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
